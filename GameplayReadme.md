## 🗺️ THE WORLD MAP

The kingdom consists of **6 regions** radiating from the Royal Capital, featuring **42 unique locations** spread across a spoke-and-hub layout. The world map supports **seasonal backdrop images** that crossfade as the seasons change in-game.

**Seasonal Backdrops:**
- 🌸 **Spring** - Cherry blossoms, fresh green meadows
- ☀️ **Summer** - Lush forests, golden wheat fields
- 🍂 **Autumn** - Orange/red foliage, harvest colors
- ❄️ **Winter** - Snow blankets, frozen rivers

*See `gameworldprompt.md` for AI image generation prompts to create custom backdrops.*

### Regions & Zone Progression

The realm is divided into zones with **outpost one-time passes** controlling access. Pay once, cross forever!

| Region | Outpost | One-Time Fee | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Riverlands** (South) | None | FREE | Starting area |
| **Royal Capital** | None | FREE | Center hub, always accessible |
| **Eastern Kingdoms** | Eastern Gate | **750g** | Exotic spices/silk |
| **Northern Highlands** | Northern Gate | **500g** | Cold, furs/iron |
| **Western Marches** | Western Gate | **600g** | Wild frontier |

**🦇 The Back Path (Bypass the Capital):**
There's a secret route connecting East and South without passing through the capital!
`Coastal Cave → Smuggler's Cove` - Perfect for smugglers and those who know the back roads.

**💀 Main Quest Progression:**
The story guides you through zones naturally:
1. Start in Riverlands (South) → Capital (FREE) → Unlock regions via outposts
2. Trade and build wealth between each zone gate
3. Defeat dungeon bosses to unlock portals to the **Doom World**
4. Final boss **GREEDY WON** awaits in the Destroyed Royal Capital

### Location Types

| **Capital** | 👑 | Royal goods, luxury items, highest prices |
| **City** | 🏰 | Large markets, all property types |

## 💀 DUNGEON EXPLORATION SYSTEM

*"Into the darkness you go, where the dead keep their treasures and the living rarely return."*

When you arrive at a dungeon, ruins, or unique location, you don't just walk in—you EXPLORE. The exploration system presents interactive choices based on what horrors await within.

### How It Works

1. **Arrive** at a dungeon/ruins/cave location
2. **Choose** from available exploration options (dig for gold, explore passages, etc.)
3. **Preview** the health/stamina cost before committing
4. **Execute** and receive your outcome (loot, injury, or both)
5. **Cooldown** - Each location only spawns new events every 12 hours

### Survival Assessment

Before committing to any exploration action, you'll see a survival assessment:

| Difficulty | Recommended Gear | Survival Chance |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 🟢 **Easy** | None needed | 95% |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Basic armor & weapon | 70% |
| 🔴 **Hard** | Full gear recommended | 40% |
| 💀 **Deadly** | Even legends die here | 20% |

*Survival chance is modified by your equipment, stats, and buffs. An ungeared peasant wandering into a deadly dungeon is just donating their corpse to the local skeleton population.*

### Exploration Events

- Light candles at the altar

**Throne Room Events:**

**Mining Events:**

- Assess stability first

## ⏰ TIME & SURVIVAL

### Time System

**Calendar:** The game uses the actual Gregorian calendar with real month names, correct days per month, and leap years. The game begins on **April 1st, 1111**.

**Time Display:** `April 1, 1111 - 08:00`

```
1 real second = 2 game minutes (Normal speed)
              = 10 game minutes (Fast)
              = 30 game minutes (Very Fast)
```

**Travel Time Examples (at Normal speed):**
| Game Time | Real Time | Example Journey |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 30 min | 15 sec | Short village hop |
| 1 hour | 30 sec | Town to town |
| 2 hours | 60 sec | City to distant outpost |
| 4 hours | 2 min | Cross-region trek |

| Time Period | Hours | Effects |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Morning | 6:00-12:00 | +2% market prices |
| Afternoon | 12:00-18:00 | Standard prices |
| Evening | 18:00-22:00 | -2% market prices |
| Night | 22:00-6:00 | Some shops closed, dangers higher |

### Survival Stats

Stats now decay automatically as time passes. The decay system runs every 30 game minutes and is affected by the current season.

| Stat | Base Decay | Empty Penalty | Notes |
|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| **Hunger** | -1 per 30min | -1 health/tick | Affected by season |
| **Thirst** | -1.2 per 30min | -1.5 health/tick | Higher in summer |
| **Stamina** | -2 while traveling | Slower travel | Recovers when resting |
| **Health** | Varies | Death at 0 | Damaged by starvation/dehydration |
| **Happiness** | Varies | Affects all stats | Drops when other stats low |

### Seasonal Effects on Stats

Each season modifies stat decay rates:

| Season | Hunger Drain | Thirst Drain | Stamina Drain |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Spring** | 1.0x | 1.0x | 0.95x |
| **Summer** | 0.9x | **1.3x** | 1.1x |
| **Autumn** | 1.1x | 0.9x | 1.0x |
| **Winter** | **1.3x** | 0.7x | **1.4x** |

*In summer, carry extra water. In winter, stock up on food and rest often.*

### Weather System

The world has dynamic weather that affects gameplay:

| Weather | Visual Effect | Gameplay Effect |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Clear** ☀️ | Sunny skies | Normal travel speed |
| **Cloudy** ☁️ | Overcast | Slightly slower travel |
| **Rain** 🌧️ | Rain particles | -10% travel speed |
| **Storm** ⛈️ | Rain + Lightning | -20% speed, +encounter chance |
| **Fog** 🌫️ | Dense fog | -15% speed, reduced visibility |
| **Snow** ❄️ | Snowflakes | -25% speed (winter only) |
| **Blizzard** 🌨️ | Heavy snow + wind | -40% speed, +stamina drain |
| **Apocalypse** ☄️ | Meteors, red sky | -50% speed, 2x encounters |

Weather changes naturally based on season and time, but certain events (like The Dark Convergence) can trigger special weather.

### Death
When health hits 0, you die. Your high score is recorded based on:
- Gold accumulated
- Days survived
- Cause of death

*There is no respawn. Only a new game. Like life itself.*

## 💀 THE DARK CONVERGENCE (July 18th)

*"Once a year, the veil between worlds thins, and the dungeons call to those brave enough to answer..."*

Every **July 18th**, a special event occurs called **The Dark Convergence**. On this day:

| Effect | Normal | During Event |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Dungeon Travel Time** | 60-120 minutes | **30 minutes** |
| **Dungeon Cooldowns** | 12 hours | **REMOVED** |
| **Boss Fights** | Limited by cooldowns | **Unlimited** |

### Why It Matters

The "Dungeon Crawler" hidden achievement requires defeating **50 dungeon bosses within 5 in-game years**. With normal 12-hour cooldowns, this is extremely challenging. The Dark Convergence makes it possible to complete this achievement in a single glorious day of dungeon crawling!

### Strategy for July 18th

1. **Prepare beforehand** - Stock up on food, bandages, and weapons
2. **Start at midnight** - You have 24 hours of dungeon madness
3. **Travel fast** - Every dungeon is only 30 minutes away
4. **No cooldowns** - Hit every dungeon multiple times!
5. **Track your kills** - You can clear 20+ dungeons in one day

### Dungeon Backdrop

When you enter a dungeon, cave, ruins, or mine, the world map fades to a dark **dungeon backdrop** to set the mood. The backdrop transitions smoothly as you travel in and out of dungeon locations.

### ☄️ Apocalypse Weather

During The Dark Convergence, the world is consumed by apocalyptic weather:

- **☄️ Meteor Showers** - Fiery meteors streak across the sky every 3-10 seconds
- **🔴 Red Sky** - Pulsing crimson atmosphere
- **🔥 Embers** - Floating fire particles rise from below
- **⚡ Lightning** - Intense electrical storms

This dramatic effect triggers automatically on July 18th, or can be activated manually with the `doom` debug command.

### The Doom Command

For those who want to summon The Dark Convergence at will, the `doom` debug command triggers:

1. **Apocalypse Weather** - Full meteor shower effect
2. **Dungeon World Backdrop** - Map fades to dungeon view
3. **Bonanza Benefits** - 30-min travel + no cooldowns for one game day

This works on both the **main menu** (menu weather system) and **in-game** (game weather system).

## 🎭 RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

As you travel the roads and visit locations, you may encounter random NPCs. The world is alive with wanderers, merchants, pilgrims, and less savory folk.

### Encounter Types

|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Traveler** | ✅ Yes | Fellow road-walker with basic supplies |

| **Robber** | ❌ No | Hostile - might attack |
| **Beggar** | ❌ No | May ask for gold |

### How Encounters Work

1. **Time Pauses** - When an encounter triggers, game time automatically pauses
2. **Choose Your Action** - Talk to them, Trade with them (if tradeable), or Ignore
3. **Trade** - Tradeable NPCs carry randomized inventories based on their type
4. **Time Resumes** - When you dismiss the encounter or end the conversation

### Encounter Chances

- **30%** chance per travel journey
- **20%** chance when arriving at a new location
- **30 minute** cooldown between encounters

### Tradeable NPC Inventories

**Smugglers:** Rare items - poisons, lockpicks, contraband, thieves' tools
**Couriers:** Travel gear - stamina potions, maps, signal flares

## 💀 TIPS FROM THE VOID

### Early Game Strategy
1. **Don't starve** - Buy food before fancy items
2. **Start small** - Trade common goods first
3. **Learn routes** - Memorize which locations have what
4. **Upgrade transport** - Hand cart → Mule → Horse & Cart
5. **Save often** - The road is dangerous

### Mid Game Strategy
1. **Buy properties** - Passive income is king
2. **Hire employees** - They work while you travel
3. **Set trade routes** - Automated profit
4. **Specialize** - Focus on one trade route that works

### Late Game Goals
1. **Own the Capital** - Maximum prices, all goods
2. **Legendary items** - Dragon scales, phoenix feathers
3. **All achievements** - For the completionists
4. **Break the economy** - Become too rich to fail

### Pro Tips
- 🌙 **Travel at night** - Some events only happen then
- 🏪 **Check multiple markets** - Prices vary daily
- 💰 **Buy dips** - Market crashes are opportunities
- 🏠 **Properties compound** - More properties = more workers = more income
- ⚔️ **Carry a weapon** - Bandits don't negotiate
- 📊 **Watch the trends** - Price history shows patterns

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Buying transport you can't use efficiently
- ❌ Ignoring survival stats until critical
- ❌ Overinvesting in one location
- ❌ Not saving before dangerous journeys
- ❌ Forgetting to check employee wages

    Time Invested: too many sleepless nights to count
    Bugs Created: countless
    Bugs Fixed: most of them (probably)
    Sanity Remaining: questionable

    "we're all just merchants trading our time for arbitrary
     numerical increases... might as well have fun doing it."
