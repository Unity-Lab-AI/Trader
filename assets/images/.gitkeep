# 🖤 World Map Backdrop Images

Place your AI-generated world map images here. The game supports seasonal backdrops with crossfade transitions!

## Seasonal Backdrops (Recommended)
Create 4 versions of your map, one for each season:
- `world-map-spring.png` - Blooming flowers, green fields
- `world-map-summer.png` - Lush green, bright sun
- `world-map-autumn.png` - Orange/red leaves, harvest colors
- `world-map-winter.png` - Snow covered, frozen lakes

When the in-game season changes, the backdrop will smoothly crossfade (2 second transition).

## Single Backdrop (Fallback)
If you only want one image:
- `world-map-backdrop.png`

## Technical Requirements
- Dimensions: 2400x1800 pixels (or will be scaled to fit)
- Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- Coordinate origin: (0,0) at top-left

## Generation Prompts
See `gameworldprompt.md` in the root directory for AI image generation prompts.

## Testing
Use browser console to manually change seasons:
```javascript
GameWorldRenderer.setSeason('winter');
GameWorldRenderer.setSeason('spring');
```
