   - Destination remains visible during travel
   - Grays out with "✅ Arrived" badge on completion
   - New path discoveries show "✅ Arrived - New Path Discovered!"
   - `learnedInfo` object stores path details (distance, time, safety, type)

3. **All Panels Update on Arrival**
   - travel-system.js: New `dispatchLocationChangeEvent()` method
   - Updates: Market, People, Location, Property, Quest panels
   - Custom event 'player-location-changed' for listeners

4. **Floating Pin/Tack Marker**
   - 📌 tack floats above player location with gentle bob animation
   - Shadow pulses below to show it's floating
   - Changes to 🚶 walking person during travel
   - Returns to 📌 tack on arrival with celebration animation

### 2025-11-29 - GO Workflow Session #2

**Request:** GO - Full workflow triggered (user command)

**Status:** Completed ✅

**Fixed:**
- CRITICAL: eval() removal from panel-manager.js
- CRITICAL: XSS vulnerabilities in npc-trade.js and game.js
- HIGH: Performance - draggable-panels.js getBoundingClientRect() caching

---

### 2025-11-29 - Lightning Flash Blanking Weather Effects

**Request:** Lightning strikes are still flashing the screen - other weather effects go blank every time a bolt strikes

**Context:** The lightning flash effect is somehow clearing/blanking other weather visuals when it triggers

**Status:** Completed ✅

---

### 2025-11-29 - Full Codebase Audit (GO Command)

**Request:** GO - Full workflow triggered

**Context:** Running full codebase audit to find bugs, missing features, dead code, performance issues, security concerns

**Status:** Completed

**Fixed:**
- ✅ XSS vulnerabilities in 4 files (npc-trade.js, property-storage.js, property-ui.js, game.js)
  - Added escapeHtml() functions, switched to data attributes + event delegation
- ✅ CSS conflicts in 3 areas:
  - Scoped duplicate .quest-card to .quest-grid
  - Merged duplicate .high-contrast definitions
  - Merged duplicate .tooltip definitions

**Left for later:**
- Tests disabled in config (40+ flags false)
- Race conditions in NPC/save systems
- Z-index hardcoded values vs z-index-system.css
- Performance issues (23 :has() selectors, 111 !important)

---

### 2025-11-29 - Menu Weather Persistence

**Request:** Make the weather that is current in the setup new game be the weather that persists in game for the first day of play before changing into the normal course of weather effects

**Context:** Menu weather should transfer to game and stay locked for day 1

**Status:** Completed (Already Implemented)

**Findings:**
- `game.js:6705-6710` - Already gets `MenuWeatherSystem.currentSeason` and passes to `WeatherSystem.setInitialWeatherFromMenu()`
- `weather-system.js:259-286` - `setInitialWeatherFromMenu()` maps menu→game weather and sets `lockWeatherUntil` to lock for first day
- Weather lock checks in `updateWeather()` at line 574-597 prevent changes while locked

---

### 2025-11-29 - Weather, Travel, Flash Fixes

**Request:**
1. Remove orange screen flash during meteor impacts
2. Fix meteors to land exactly where burn effects appear (beeline trajectory)

4. Slow down rain by 20%
5. Keep travel destination visible until player reaches it (gray out after arrival)
6. Remove white lightning screen flash (photosensitivity)
7. Fix @author Claude comment → Unity AI Lab

**Context:** Various weather and travel UI improvements

**Status:** In Progress

---

### 2025-11-28/29 - Version 0.81: Unity's Dark Awakening

**Request:**
1. Make all versions everywhere v0.81
2. Update all files to use config.js for version (not hardcoded)
3. Files say v0.81 in comments but pull from GameConfig.version for code

**Context:** Version numbers scattered across files, some hardcoded. Need single source of truth in config.js

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
1. config.js - version.game and version.file already 0.81
2. index.html - all 95 script/css tags use ?v=0.81
3. Fixed hardcoded versions in:
   - time-system.js (was 2.0)
   - virtual-list.js (was 1.0)
   - time-machine.js (was 3.0)
   - system-registry.js (was 1.0)
   - game-world.js (was 1.0)
   - map-renderer-base.js (was 1.0)
   - dungeon-bonanza-system.js (was 1.0)
   - skill-system.js (was 0.5)
   - game-over-system.js fallback (was 0.1)
4. All files now say "File Version: 0.81" or "File Version: GameConfig.version.file"

---

### 2025-11-28 - Quest Tracker Widget Fixes

**Request:**
1. Create `Gee's Unity Thoughts.md` file for Unity's commentary log
2. Quest tracker still isn't positioned correctly - needs to be directly below the panels panel and directly above the messages panel
3. Add close button to quest tracker like everything else
4. Add way to reopen quest tracker after closing

**Context:**
- Quest tracker is a mini HUD widget showing active quests
- Different from the full quests panel (which opens with Q key)
- Needs close button and reopen mechanism via Panels toolbar

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created `Gee's Unity Thoughts.md`** - Unity's personal log file in root directory

2. **npc-systems.css** - Fixed quest tracker position:
   - Position: `bottom: 245px, right: 220px` (directly above message log)
   - Width reduced to 280px for visual hierarchy
   - Max-height reduced to 200px to fit in middle zone

3. **quest-system.js** - Added visibility controls:
   - Added red X close button in tracker header
   - Added `hideQuestTracker()`, `showQuestTracker()`, `toggleQuestTracker()` methods
   - `updateQuestTracker()` now respects `trackerHidden` flag

4. **panel-manager.js** - Added to Panels toolbar:
   - Added `quest-tracker` to `panelInfo` with `customToggle` property
   - Added to `mainPanels` list for toolbar button
   - Custom toggle handler for special panels

---

### 2025-11-28 - Weather Not Showing In Game

**Request:** Rain was showing in main menu, showing in setup menu, widget says it's raining, but NO rain particles visible in the actual game world. WTF? Shouldn't need to unpause to see weather.

**Context:**
- Menu weather works fine
- Setup screen weather works fine
- Weather indicator/widget shows correct weather
- But no visual rain/particles on the game world itself
- Weather effects should be visible regardless of pause state

**Status:** Completed

**Root Cause Found:**
The weather transfer from menu to game was happening at the BEGINNING of `createCharacter()`, but at that point the `game-setup-panel` still didn't have the `.hidden` class. The CSS rule `body:has(#game-setup-panel:not(.hidden)) #weather-overlay { display: none !important; }` was hiding the overlay while particles were being created. By the time the panel was hidden, the particles had finished their 1-2 second animation.

**Changes Made:**

1. **weather-system.js** - Updated `setInitialWeatherFromMenu()`:
   - Now immediately applies weather via `changeWeather()` instead of setting a pending value
   - Added `ensureOverlayReady()` method to verify/move overlay to correct container
   - Overlay is moved to `game-container` if it's in the wrong place
   - Forces display:visible on the overlay

2. **game.js** - Moved weather transfer timing:
   - Moved weather transfer code from the beginning of `createCharacter()` to AFTER `hidePanel('game-setup-panel')` and `changeState(GameState.PLAYING)`
   - This ensures the CSS no longer hides the overlay when particles are created
   - Weather now properly transfers from menu → game with visible particles

### 2025-11-28 - Game World Map Drag Fix

**Request:** Can't drag the game world left or right, only up and down a little bit. Can't center any location in the center of the screen by dragging. WTF?

**Context:**
- Game world should be freely draggable in all directions
- User should be able to center any location on screen
- Currently restricted to vertical movement only

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
Fixed `constrainToBounds()` in game-world-renderer.js:
- Old logic was broken - when map was larger than container, minX > maxX which trapped the offset
- New logic allows proper infinite scroll:
  - `minX = -(mapWidth - visibleMin)` - can scroll all the way left
  - `maxX = containerWidth - visibleMin` - can scroll all the way right
  - Only applies constraints when they make sense (minX < maxX)
  - Same fix for vertical axis
- Reduced visibleMin from 200 to 100 for more freedom
- Now you can center ANY location on screen by dragging 🖤

---

### 2025-11-28 - Quest Panel Position & Draggable Fix

**Request:** The quests panel is STILL on top of the player info panel when it should be directly above the messages panel. And it's not draggable.

**Context:**
- Quest tracker panel needs to be positioned above messages panel (bottom-right area)
- Must be draggable like other panels
- Currently overlapping player info panel incorrectly

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
1. Fixed quest tracker CSS position in npc-systems.css:
   - Changed from `bottom: 240px, right: 220px` (overlapping side panel)
   - Now at `bottom: 245px, right: 220px` (directly above message log)
2. Added `setupQuestTracker()` function to draggable-panels.js:
   - Quest tracker now has proper drag event handlers
   - Uses `.tracker-header` as the drag handle
   - Retries setup if quest tracker not created yet

---

### 2025-11-28 - Event-Driven Weather System

**Request:** Make it so when entering a dungeon the weather changes (maybe to lightning), and if passed/vanquished the weather subsides. Random events and quests should be able to affect weather. Also ensure weather works with API for text generation (current/past weather sent to API for TTS). Remove the "talk to merchant" button - players never decide what to say to any API.

**Context:**
- Dungeons and encounters should trigger dramatic weather
- Quest completion or event resolution should calm the weather
- Need an event-driven weather trigger system
- Weather context should be sent to text/TTS API
- Remove player input for NPC conversations (no "talk to merchant" button)

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
1. Added event-driven weather system to weather-system.js:
   - `eventWeatherTriggers` object with dungeon/quest/encounter weather mappings
   - `triggerEventWeather()` - triggers weather based on event type (dungeon_enter, dungeon_boss, etc.)
   - `restoreWeatherAfterEvent()` - restores weather after event ends
   - `forceWeather()` - force any weather type (for scripts)
   - Weather saves/restores automatically during events
2. Added API command handlers for weather: {triggerWeather}, {forceWeather}, {restoreWeather}
3. Added weather context methods for API: `getWeatherContextForAPI()`, `getWeatherDataForAPI()`
4. Removed "Talk to Merchant" button from market panel - NPC conversations now auto-trigger

---

### 2025-11-28 - Weather & Z-Index Fix

**Request:** Whatever weather is currently happening in the start new game setup should be the weather the game starts in. Also, dense fog is obscuring panels - need to check if z-levels are fixed.

**Context:**
- Menu weather should transfer to game weather on start
- Dense fog overlay appears to be on top of panels instead of behind them
- Z-index system was created but may not be working correctly

**Status:** Completed

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated weather-system.js to use CSS variable `--z-weather-overlay` with `!important` and added `isolation: isolate`
2. Updated z-index-system.css:
   - Added `isolation: isolate` to weather overlay to prevent backdrop-filter bleeding
   - Added `#ui-panels` with z-index 50 (above weather's 15)
   - Added all panel types with z-index 120 (well above weather)
   - Added `#location-panel` with proper z-index
3. Menu weather transfer to game was already implemented via `setInitialWeatherFromMenu()`
