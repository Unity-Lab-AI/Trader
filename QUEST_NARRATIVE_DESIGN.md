## 🎭 THE OVERARCHING NARRATIVE

### The Two Intertwined Threats

**THREAT 1: The Shadow Rising (Malachar)**
The ancient wizard Malachar, thought dead for centuries, stirs in the Shadow Tower. His dark magic seeps across the land, corrupting creatures, causing strange phenomena, and preparing for his return.

**THREAT 2: The Merchant Conspiracy (The Black Ledger)**
A secret cabal of corrupt merchants called "The Black Ledger" has been funding Malachar's return, believing they can control him and monopolize all trade. They're wrong, but their greed blinds them.

**THE TWIST:** These threats are intertwined. The Black Ledger funds Malachar. Defeating one weakens the other. The player discovers this connection in Act 3.

## 🌋 DOOM WORLD SYSTEM

### Concept
When player defeats EITHER main dungeon boss (Shadow Tower Guardian or Ruins Guardian), a portal opens. Player can choose to enter the DOOM WORLD - an apocalyptic alternate reality where Malachar won and the world fell to darkness.

### Portal Mechanics
- **Two dungeons** (Shadow Tower in west, Ruins of Malachar in north) each have a portal
- **Defeating a boss** opens that portal permanently (until boss respawns)
- **Enter via boss victory panel** - shows loot, stats, and "Enter Doom World" button
- **Exit only via dungeon safe zones** - the dungeon you entered from is safe
- **Other dungeon portal** is also safe zone - must travel through Doom World to reach it
- **Tracked quests still visible** but tooltip warns "Escape the Doom World first!"

### Doom World Map
Uses existing doom map (debooger "doom" command). Same location positions but:
- All locations renamed (Royal Capital → Destroyed Royal Capital)
- Inns → Inn Wreckage
- Markets → Ruined Market (still function with doom economy)
- Same NPCs but with doom-specific dialogue and API instructions

### Doom World Economy

### Doom World Bosses

### Doom World Central Boss: GREEDY WON
