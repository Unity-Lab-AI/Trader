## 💀 TIPS FROM THE VOID

### Early Game Strategy
1. **Don't starve** - Buy food before fancy items
2. **Start small** - Trade common goods first
3. **Learn routes** - Memorize which locations have what
4. **Upgrade transport** - Hand cart → Mule → Horse & Cart
5. **Save often** - The road is dangerous

### Mid Game Strategy
1. **Buy properties** - Passive income is king
2. **Hire employees** - They work while you travel
3. **Set trade routes** - Automated profit
4. **Specialize** - Focus on one trade route that works

### Late Game Goals
1. **Own the Capital** - Maximum prices, all goods
2. **Legendary items** - Dragon scales, phoenix feathers
3. **All achievements** - For the completionists
4. **Break the economy** - Become too rich to fail

### Pro Tips
- 🌙 **Travel at night** - Some events only happen then
- 🏪 **Check multiple markets** - Prices vary daily
- 💰 **Buy dips** - Market crashes are opportunities
- 🏠 **Properties compound** - More properties = more workers = more income
- ⚔️ **Carry a weapon** - Bandits don't negotiate
- 📊 **Watch the trends** - Price history shows patterns

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Buying transport you can't use efficiently
- ❌ Ignoring survival stats until critical
- ❌ Overinvesting in one location
- ❌ Not saving before dangerous journeys
- ❌ Forgetting to check employee wages
